<p font-size: 17pt><u>How I feel about him? </u><ul> <li>I have loved Anderson Cooper for a while now. He is such  <br>  an influential person to me. I have a scrapbook of <br>just him;  pictures of him, his articles, quotes. I <br> love watching Anderson Cooper 360. He is also <br> very kind and values family ties. He wrote a <br>book with his mother called  "The Rainbow <br> Comes and Goes", which I am currently <br> reading. It is very good. He is just a phenomal <br> writer and jorunalist and I am very glad to <br> have discovered him.</li></ul></p><br><br>

<br><p style="background-color:white">The Rainbow Comes and Goes is "a touching and intimate correspondence between Anderson Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, offering timeless wisdom and a revealing glimpse into their lives". I'm personally enjoying the book because it's honest and they are both very open with each other. They touch upon tough subjects like the suicide of Anderson's brother and the death of his father and his mother's sickness.</p>
