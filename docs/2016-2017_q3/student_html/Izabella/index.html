Joseph, Thomas and Saliah began this band in 2009, slowly gaining popularity. Later on in 2011, both Saliah and Thomas left the group, leaving Tyler Joseph as the only member of the group. Quickly, Joseph found Josh Dun, the newest member of the group. With Joseph as the lead singer and pianist, and Dun as the percussionist at the drums, the band continued on, rising to fame. The release of their second album, <i> Regional at Best, </i> brought them more popularity. The growing band continued on, striving for a hit, and released in 2013 their albums <i> Three Songs EP </i> and <i> Vessel </i> with songs such as <i> House of Gold </i> and <i> Ode to Sleep. </i> Finally, in 2015, Twenty One Pilots reached the pinnacle of their success with the release of <i> Blurry Face. </i> People were obseesed with their new hit single<i> Stressed Out </i> which hit #2 in the Billboard Hot 100. They were also asked to write a song for the DC movie, <b> Suicide Squad, </b> which turned out as <i> Heathens </i> </p>
