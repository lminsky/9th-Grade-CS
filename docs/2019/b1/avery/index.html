	<h2> About Him </h2>
	<hr>
	<h2> Name </h2>
	<h3 class = "demoClass"> My dog's name is Mr. Adam Benjamin Dog.  He is named as such because </h3> 
		<ul class = "demoClass">  
			<li> Upon hearing Bennie and the Jets by Elton John he started doing a little dance </li>
			<li> Adam as the name given by the breeder </li>
			<li> And Mr. Dog as my little brother's two cents </li>
			</ul>  
	<hr>
	<h2> Age </h2>
	<h3> Bennie is 5 years old. We got him when I was in 4th grade and my brother was in 2nd, which probably explains the whole "Mr. Dog" thing.</h3>
