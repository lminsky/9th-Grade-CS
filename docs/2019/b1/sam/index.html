<h2><i>Diagnosis and What is Diabetes</i></h2>
<p>I was diagnossed with type one diabetes at 21 months old. That's very young for diagnosis, and I see that as both a blessing and  curse. Since I don't remember a time without diabetes, I am never longing for that, but I also have more time for the disease to affect my body. For those of you who don't know how diabetes works, here's a quick little lesson. Your pancreas has special cells in it called beta cells. Beta cells produce the gland insulin, which breaks down the sugar in our blood. Beta cells also do not regenerate. Now when I was a baby, I got sick, and my imune system fought the virus but also ended up damaging my beta cells, which is why I have diabetes. Type one diabetes is classified as an auto imune disease, because it forms after your imune system attacks another part of your body. Without my beta cells, I need to give myself artificial insulin in a "pump", or in injections. That is how diabetes happens, and why I wear a pump everyday.</p>
<h3><u>What are we doing about it</u></h3>
<p>Well, we are raising money to go towards artificial pancreas and beta cell regrowth technology, we raise awareness with walks across our coubtry, and we do a host of different fundraisers and events to do all of the above. Every year, 40,000 people are diagnossed with Type one diabetes, and our goal is to slowly bring that number down to zero, step by step, until we find a cure.</p>
