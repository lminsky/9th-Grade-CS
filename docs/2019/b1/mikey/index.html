	<h2>I love to ski.</h2>
	<hr>
	<h4>I started learning to ski when I was <b>two years old</b>.</h4>
	<p> My favorite place to ski is <u>Smuggler's notch</u>, which is a ski resort in Vermont. This resort is very close to Jacksonville, and Stowe, another popular ski resort. </p>

	<p> When you are first learning to ski, it is much easier to learn with the front of your skis pointing towards each other, making a wedge shape. This is sometimes referred to as <i>pizza</i>. As you become better, you will start to keep your skis parallel to each other, commonly referred to as <i>french fry</i>, and keep turning so that your skis are pointing across the trail.</p>

<p class="Border"> my favorite ski trails at Smuggler's Notch are:
	<ol class="Border">
		<li> Black Snake </li>
		<li> Smuggler's Alley </li>
		<li> Upper F.I.S </li>

	</ol>

	<strong>Skiing Level:</strong>
	<select>
		<option value="beginner">Beginner</option>
		<option value="intermediate">Intermediate</option>
		<option value="expert">Expert</option>
	</select>
	<br>These levels determine how tight the ski fits around your boot.
	<br>
	<span style="color:red">As you become a better skier the ski is made tighter on your boot because if you fall and your ski pops off, then it may fall and slide down the trail without you. As a better skier, you will do harder and steeper trails, where if your ski falls off then it might slide down the hill.</span>
