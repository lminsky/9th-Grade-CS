	<h2>What is it</h2>
	<h3>It's a chain of convience stores that also serve food</h3>
	<h4>Started in Pennsylvania</h4>
	<h5>Let's get into it</h5>


	<P><b>Sheetz was founded by Bob Sheetz in 1952 in Altoona, Pennsylvania.</b>
	<br> 
<img src=SheetzFoundersPhoto.jpg width="250px" alt="SheetzFounders" img>
<br>
		<i>It was founded on the basis of efficiency and freshness.</I> 
		<br>
		<p>Sheetz prides itself on its loyalty to its costomers. Since day 1, Sheetz has evolved and rebranded to fit customers' demands. To emphasize this mission, on Sheetz website it states:
			<br>
			<q><i>Our vision is to create the business that will put Sheetz, as we know it today, out of business. That's what keeps us on top and keeps us focused on ways to make our business even more sucessful in the future.</i></q></p>
			<H3>A Common Misconception</H3>
			<p class="red">Many think of Sheetz as <q>just a gas station,</q> but it is <i>way</i> more than that. Many loyal Sheetz customers find it irritating when referring to Sheetz as just a gas station, because it takes away from the delicious meals they serve. Below is a video by <i>Business Insider</i> explaining how exactly Sheetz customers feel when such a statement is made</p>

	<!-- Here are my first paragraphs, I wonder if there is a way to divide them more noticeably besides not making them bold. Maybe changing the font? -->
	<h3>What Can Sheetz Do for You</h3>
	<!-- here I realized you could put large bold headings anywhere, and you could have more than one type of bold heading in the same website. It is a helpful tool to divide your website so the visitor does not get incredibly bored, and it would also be good when listing important information -->
	<p><b>Sheetz can assist you with a range of problems.</b> Most notably when you need to buy something that a convenience store would have, or if you want food.</p>
	<h3>Why Sheetz?</h3>
	<p><b>I'll tell you why!</b> Sheetz is <i>very</i> tasty. It is a great store.</p>
		<h3>Here's How <i>You</i> Can Support Sheetz</h3>

		<p>Sheetz has a variety of merchandise, ranging from shirts, to beanies, to even Sheetz converse! Below are photos of a few of the articles of clothing you can buy, and link to get to them.</p>

	<!-- Here's my las paragraph so far. I want to leave it at a cliffhanger and make this website into one large Sheetz sponsor. -->
