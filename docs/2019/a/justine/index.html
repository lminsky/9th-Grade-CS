	<p>The vampire diaries is about a orphan girl named Elena Gilbert living in a small town called Mystic Falls. One day a man named Stefan Salvator and his brother, Damon Salvatore, move back into town and everything changes for Elena and her friends. She discovers secrets about the town, herself and who Damon and Stefan really are. <b>Vampires!</b> Her whole life changes as she goes through crazy adventures, wether it was falling in love with Stefan and Damon, finding her evil doppelganger, helping her brother and much more. The show gets an average of 5 million viewers per season and is loved by many people. Including me! I definitly reccomend this show for you to watch. 

		<p> This is now one of my favorite shows because it keeps me very intrigued and is so interesting. The plots for each season is so unexpected and each episode leaves you on a cliff hanger. I'm also done with the last season, I just recently started watching it. The genre of the show is supernatural/fantasy so I think that the elements of people not being human is really cool beacuse you get to see how someone lives in a different lifestyle than yours. This show also has a sequal which is The Originals. But instead of their being vampires, there are werewolves. That is the next show that I am going to watch when I am done. :)<br>
