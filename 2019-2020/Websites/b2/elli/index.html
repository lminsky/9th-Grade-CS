<h2> Start of our trip:  </h2>

<p class="love">  We went to the <b>Dominican Republic</b> this break and worked with the Mariposa Foundation. The first day we arrived and got settled. Our room was small and cute. I felt at home with the sea shell mirror and the geckos on the wall. We swam and ate dinner in the hotel. The rooms We're like a bunch of small houses or rooms on a beautiful Hill. When you walk to the top of the hill you could see the valley below. When we arrived at the Mariposa is it was a little awkward at first. They were young and they were saying.  We got in a huge circle and saying a few songs and then split up into groups. The girls in my group where so sweet and kind. It took me a while to adjust to them though because I couldn't understand a thing they were saying. That moment, I realized that I have been learning a lot of grammar Spanish and not really learning how to talk. After more activities and a tour of the Facility after the girls left for school, we headed back to our hotel and swam and chilled. The morning was by the best part about being in the DR.  I would wake up Kennedy because she wouldn't get out of bed and Then open the shutters are the sunshine would bleed through the windows. It was cold outside so amazing but the Sun was shining and dew was everywhere. Each morning we would wake up and work with the girls. Over the week I got better at speaking to them and made closer connections with multiple girls:  Miranda , Diana,  and many more. I loved spending time with the girls,learning about their language and culture and sharing about ours.</p>

<h2>Being at the center:  </h2>
<p>  When at the center, we split into groups to work with the girls. We did math, games, spanish, and more. Some days, we would to special activeties with our groups; each day was spent with laughs and awkward pauses where our spanish skills failed us. On the last day we took our weeks theme of "Doctor Suess" to try to make a boat out of a box. We all got in a the pool and raced with one kid in the boat. There were a lot of laughs and sad goodbyes when they loaded onto the school bus to go to school.   <p1> <br></p>

<h2>Excursions:  </h2>
<p> We went to many places when we werent at the center.One day, we went and watched a group of boys jump off of a water fall. They would climb up the rocks and backflip off into the glowing water. Then, we went to a beach where the water was hip depth all the way out into the distance. It was warm and we layed down on the almost abanodoned beach. On the last day we stopped on a rocky beach and played frisbee into the water. We all miss the memories of lying in the sun on the beach laughing so hard that we were choking.   <p1> <br></p>
