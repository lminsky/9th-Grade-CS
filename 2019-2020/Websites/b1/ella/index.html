		<h2>For this project, I decided to create a website devoted to my favorite music artist.</h2>
		<hr>
		<p class="nameYellow"><b><i><u>Robin Skinner</u></i></b></p>
		<h6 class="nameYellow"><u>AKA Robbie</u></h6>
		<p>is a 20-year-old singer, songwriter, and guitarist who goes by cavetown.</p>
		<p>He has released two full albums, with other eps and special releases.</p>
		<p>I started listening to him in the summer of 2019, when I traveled to France and Holland, and my friend introduced him to me.</p>
		<p>After some drama in a sushi restaurant, I was able to get tickets to a concert, so now I'm going see him on November 8th, 2019.</p>
