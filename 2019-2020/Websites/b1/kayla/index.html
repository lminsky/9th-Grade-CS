		Although Siamese cats are all classified as the same thing with the same personalities their behaviour and characteristics vary through ages. For the 15 to 20 years of a siamese cats life they undergo many experiences and gain a reputation for those occurrences. Their personality and temperament is what the breed is known for. 
The cats are known to be curious social butterflies when they are kittens but lose that trait as they develop. These cats are lively and very energetic as kittens. So if a quiet, lonely cat is preferred the Siamese kitten is probably not the best choice. Being that these freshly bred animals are so enthusiastic they need a lot of food to keep their spirited character alive. On average the size of Siamese cats at young ages vary from 7 to 10 pounds. Although, these kittens are very fun to be around they get accustomed to being played with therefore the babies are very demanding of attention which could possibly be a fall back if time is a scarcity.  They also love to investigate and expand their knowledge even if they are confined to four walls.
When the Siamese cats get older, however, they lose the reputation they once had. According to studies as they get older, similar to humans they mature and grow out of their kitten like behaviour. When they develop they become more relaxed and independent. The fully grown cats no longer need to be tended to. They are now able to bathe themselves, by way of tongue, they are able to eat when hungry and go to the bathroom (litter box) when necessary without being directed. Unlike the babies, the older Siamese cats are very simple and quiet which is good for an investor who just wants some quiet company during their lonelier times. The older cats have gained a sense of privateness. Siamese cats  also possess the ability to be very cheery even when the cats are going through an illness so it is important that they go to the veterinarian often so that their health does not decrease. Even though these cats may be private they never like to be left alone because they get bored easily especially when aging but even more so as kittens. 
  Many people also find both the Siamese cats' and kittens' loyalty charming. As previously stated the Siamese cats have experience being loyal and protective because the cats used to guard the grave of royalty when they pass on. In many people’s eyes this is a positive trait and very well needed in many pets today.  These cats are very vocal and even knowing that they cannot be understood they take every opportunity to “voice” their opinion. The Siamese cats and kittens are very high maintenance emotionally but physically and grooming wise they are not a problem. Siamese cats just require a few brushes and love in order to strive. Their independence makes them the ideal cat.
